                <h2 class="animate-on-scroll">The Harvard Conglomerate</h2>
                <p class="animate-on-scroll">Pin Hill's story begins over a quarter billion years ago. The hill is
                    composed of a rare geological
                    formation known as the "Harvard Conglomerate," found almost exclusively in this town. These tilted
                    beds of dark gray, slate-like phyllite and pebbly conglomerate were formed from ancient layers of
                    black mud and gravel, creating the dramatic ledges we see today.</p>

                <br><br>

                <h2 class="animate-on-scroll">The Stonecutting Trade</h2>
                <p class="animate-on-scroll">In the early 1700s, Pin Hill became a hub of industry. The slate-like
                    quality of the rock made it
                    perfect for quarrying. A flourishing stonecutting trade emerged, and today, you can still find
                    gravestones cut from Pin Hill slate in many nearby old cemeteries. The steep ledges and quarry cuts
                    visible from the trails are silent witnesses to this bustling past.</p>

                <br><br>

                <h2 class="animate-on-scroll">Water Power</h2>
                <p class="animate-on-scroll">Below the hill runs Bowers Brook, a vital resource for early Harvard
                    residents. For over a century,
                    the brook powered numerous small mill enterprises. The remains of old mills and the wooden mill race
                    add another layer to the historical tapestry of the area.</p>
